# Draft Kit 

[Beer Sheets](https://footballabsurdity.com/draft-sheet-form/) is a tool I found online and everytime I feel like I've gotten good results off of it and good feed back from people I've recommneded it to.

The original creator moved on from the site this year but it was taken over by his team so it should still reliable.

### Usage

You can go to their main page and just copy over the settings from your league. For examples here's a [direct link](https://footballabsurdity.com/draft-sheet-form/?teams=14&bn=5&qb=1&rb=2&wr=2&rwt=2&patd=6&rutd=6&retd=6&payd=0.04&ruyd=0.1&reyd=0.1&int=-1.0&rec=0.5&fum=-2.0) to the settings my family league is using. 

There doesn't seem to be support for PPFD (point per first down) so I just kept it at 1/2 ppr.
